    "### **Non-Functional Requirements**\n",
    "#### **Usability:** A key non-functional requirement that determines how easily users can learn to operate, prepare inputs for, and interpret outputs of a system or software application. Usability ensures that the system is user-friendly, intuitive, and easily accessible to all users. The goal of usability is to ensure that users can efficiently complete tasks without any unnecessary complexity or confusion. **In simpler terms, usability refers to how easy and intuitive it is for users to interact with a system.**\n",
    "#### **Reliability:** Another key non-functional requirement focusing on the system's ability to operate consistently and correctly over time. Reliability ensures that the system performs its intended functions without failure and that any errors are handled appropriately. The goal of reliability is to provide accurate results to the user and also maintain data integrity. **In simpler terms, reliability refers to the system's ability to function correctly and consistently over time.**\n",
    "#### **What are required from the User Interface and a 'README' document in order to achieve usability?** \n",
    "**User Interface Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** The UI should be clean and straightforward, minimizing clutter and providing a clear pathway for users to accomplish their goals.\n",
    "- **Accessibility:** The UI should accommodate users with different needs, such as support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and adjustable text sizes. \n",
    "- **Responsiveness:** The UI should respond quickly to the user's inputs, without any extreme lag to the point of being noticeable.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Design elements such as colors, fonts and icons should be consistent across the application to prevent any confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**README Document Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Clear Instructions:** The README should provide straightforward, step-by-step instructions on how to install, configure, and use the program.\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Coverage:** The README should explain all the essential aspects of the system one by one, such as dependencies, troubleshooting tips, and examples of common use cases.\n",
    "- **User-Friendly Language:** The README should avoid technical jargon where possible, and be written in a way that is accessible to users of varying technical expertise.\n",
    "- **Regular Updates:** The README should be regularly updated to reflect any changes or updates to the program. This is to ensure that users have access to the latest information.\n",
    "#### **What are required from the system when providing information to the user on errors and ensuring data integrity?**\n",
    "**Error Handling Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Clear Error Messages:** When errors occur, the system should provide clear and informative error messages that explain what went wrong and how the user can resolve the issue. Vague messages such as \"An error occurred.\" should be avoided as it does not give the user an explanation or instructions on how to resolve the error.\n",
    "- **Graceful Degradation:** The system should continue to operate as smoothly as possible even when some minor components fail. For example, if a non-critical feature fails, the system should still allow users to perform other tasks while trying to fix the issue in the background. If the issue reaches a critical state, the system should give the user warnings and instructions on what to do.\n",
    "- **Logging and Reporting:** Errors should be logged with sufficient detail to help developers troubleshoot and resolve issues. The system may also need to report the critical errors to a support team or administrator automatically to simplify the issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Integrity Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Validation Checks:** The system should perform validation checks on all input data to ensure that it meets expected formats and criteria before processing. The purpose of this is to prevent any corrupt or invalid data from entering the system.\n",
    "- **Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups should be made to safeguard data against loss or corruption. On top of this, the system should also have a reliable recovery mechanism to restore data to a consistent state after a failure.\n",
    "- **Consistency Guarantees:** The system should ensure that data remains consistent across all parts of the system, even in the event of concurrent access or partial system failures."

    "## **Part 2: Researching and Planning**\n",
    "### **Research of Issue and Security Requirements**\n",
    "#### **The Purpose of Conducting My Project:**\n",
    "As mentioned before, there are several purposes of conducting the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * Goal 1: To find out the average worldwide box office of all the 1000 movies combined.\n",
    "> * Goal 2: To find out the average budget of all the 1000 movies combined.\n",
    "> * Goal 3: To find out which movie genre attracted the most box office in total.\n",
    "> * Goal 4: To find out which year released the best movies.\n",
    "> * Goal 5: To find out which movie distributor had distributed the best movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve these goals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Responsibilities of the Data Source in Protecting Participant Privacy:**\n",
    "- **Data Anonymization**: Any personal data that is not essential for the analysis should be anonymized or removed to prevent the identification of individuals.\n",
    "- **Consent and Compliance**: The data source must have obtained proper consent from individuals if personal data is included, and must comply with relevant data protection regulations.\n",
    "- **Secure Storage**: The data should be stored securely, using encryption and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.\n",
    "- **Transparency**: The data source should provide clear information to everyone using it about what data is being collected, how it will be used, and who will have access to it.\n",
    "#### **My Responsibilities in Data Privacy if I Pushed This Application Live:**\n",
    "- I must only collect and use data that is necessary for the analysis. \n",
    "- I must avoid storing unnecessary personal data to reduce the risk of privacy breaches.\n",
    "- I must ensure that the application and any data storage systems are secured with encryption, access controls, and regular security audits to protect against unauthorized access or cyberattacks.\n",
    "- I must obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and processing any personal data and I must be transparent when explaining how their data will be used, stored, and shared.\n",
    "- When presenting the data publicly or sharing it with third parties, I must ensure that any identifiable information is anonymized to protect individual privacy.\n",
    "- I must use the data ethically in a manner that is respectful of the individuals and communities represented.\n",
    "- I must avoid any actions that could cause harm or misrepresent the data.\n",
    "#### **What should an application have to be secure?**\n",
    "* An application requires many crucial security factors in order to be secure. \n",
    "* The most important things that any application should have developed in order to build basic security are proper, reliable user authentication and authorization systems, which can protect against unauthorised access by ensuring that only authorised individuals or systems can access the data. \n",
    "* Some more important security practices that developers should exercise is to add input validation, data storing, and secure encryption systems. \n",
    "   - Input validation ensures that only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, which can prevent malformed data from persisting in the database. \n",
    "   - Data storage systems help keep data in a safe storage, and makes them easily accessible to users. \n",
    "   - Encryption is extremely important as it plays a major role in securing data from attackers and other cybersecurity threats. \n",
    "* Aside from those, developers themselves should also use secure protocols and APIs, implement security testing in the applications, exercise their error handling and logging skills, and make sure to maintain the applications frequently.\n",
    "#### **Terminology**\n",
    "##### **User Authentication:** A process built in computer systems by developers that verifies a person's identity, allowing them access to an online service, connected device, or other resource.\n",
    "##### **Password Hashing:** A security process that turns a password into a short string of letters and numbers using an encryption algorithm. This process prevents cybercriminals from gaining access to people's passwords if a website is hacked.\n",
    "##### **Encryption:** A process that scrambles, converts and transforms data into incomprehensible text known as ciphertext, so that only authorized parties can understand and decode the information. Encryption plays a major role in data privacy.\n",
