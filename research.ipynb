    "## **Part 1: Identifying and Defining**\n",
    "### **The Scenario and Purpose**\n",
    "**Data:** My chosen scenario includes a comprehensive list of Hollywood movies with the highest box office gross in the world. This is based on many different factors, such as the movie name, budget, distributor, worldwide sales, genre and release date. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** My goal is to attempt, discover and learn the top 100 highest-grossing Hollywood movies of all time, with the help of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access:** The dataset is published onto Kaggle with a public status, meaning anyone can view, discuss and download it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access Method:** The dataset can be downloaded on Kaggle as a CSV file, and will be analyzed in the CSV file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeetsinghnaik/top-1000-highest-grossing-movies/data\n",
    "### **Functional Requirements**\n",
    "#### **Data Loading**\n",
    "In terms of data loading, the dataset must be suitable for analysis. The dataset must be downloaded or converted into an appropriate file format for use, such as the CSV file format, as the CSV file format is typically the best to perform data analysis procedures in.\n",
    "* **Input:** The user will need to input an appropriate file format such as .CSV\n",
    "* **Output:** There wouldn't be an output.\n",
    "#### **Data Cleaning**\n",
    "In terms of data cleaning, the system will need to be able to fix or remove incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within the dataset. In terms of achieving this, the system will need to be able to identify data discrepancies using data observability tools, remove unnecessary values and duplicate data, fix structural errors, address any missing values, standardize data entry and formatting, and develop a data quality strategy.\n",
    "* **Input:** The user will need to filter data using either Pandas or Microsoft Excel.\n",
    "* **Output:** If done correctly, a neat and processed dataset should be outputted by the program used.\n",
    "#### **Data Analysis**\n",
    "In terms of data analysis, the statistical analysis will need to be able to obtain raw data and subsequently convert it into information useful for decision-making by users. Data will collected and analyzed to answer questions, test hypotheses, or disprove theories.\n",
    "* **Input:** The user will need to run a program capable of processing and analyzing data accurately.\n",
    "* **Output:** If done correctly, the used program will output the necessary analysis results requested by the user.\n",
    "#### **Data Visualization**\n",
    "In terms of data visualization, the data from the dataset will need to be represented visually through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics and even animations.\n",
    "* **Input:** The user will first need to determine what type of graphics they want to visualize the data in, then they will need to specify the type of graphics through the Matplotlib module.\n",
    "* **Output:** The system will need to output the specified graphics requested by the user. The graphics outputted must be able to present the data correctly and easily.\n",
    "#### **Data Reporting**\n",
    "In terms of data reporting, the system will need to collect unprocessed data from different sources that can later be organized into meaningful pieces of information. These pieces of information can give valuable insights and statistics about the topic of the collected data.\n",
    "* **Input:** The user will need to request statistical information from the program.\n",
    "* **Output:** The system will need to output the statistical information the user requested in a fully valid form with zero errors.\n",
    "### **Use Cases**\n",
    "#### **Data Loading**\n",
    "**Actor:** Data Analyst\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To import the correct file format as a dataset into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preconditions:** User has a dataset ready to be imported.\n",
    "> Step 1: User organizes the files and places the dataset into the appropriate folder to be read.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Step 2: System scans and reads through the dataset, then validates the dataset after approval.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Step 3: After validation, the system would be able to display the data in a dataframe.\n",

    "#### **What should an application have to be secure?**\n",
    "An application requires many crucial security factors in order to be secure. The most important things that any application should have developed in order to build basic security are proper, reliable user authentication and authorization systems, which can protect against unauthorised access by ensuring that only authorised individuals or systems can access the data. Some more important security practices that developers should exercise is to add input validation, data storing, and secure encryption systems. Input validation ensures that only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, which can prevent malformed data from persisting in the database. Data storage systems help keep data and makes them easily accessible. Encryption is extremely important as it plays a major role in securing data from attackers and other cybersecurity threats. Aside from those, developers themselves should also use secure protocols and APIs, implement security testing, exercise error handling and logging skills, and make sure to maintain the application frequently.\n",
    "#### **Terminology**\n",
    "##### **User Authentication:** A process built in computer systems by developers that verifies a person's identity, allowing them access to an online service, connected device, or other resource.\n",
    "##### **Password Hashing:** A security process that turns a password into a short string of letters and numbers using an encryption algorithm. This process prevents cybercriminals from gaining access to people's passwords if a website is hacked.\n",
    "##### **Encryption:** A process that scrambles, converts and transforms data into incomprehensible text known as ciphertext, so that only authorized parties can understand and decode the information. Encryption plays a major role in data privacy.\n",
