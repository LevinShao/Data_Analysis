    "* **Input:** The user will need to run a program capable of processing and analyzing data accurately.\n",
    "* **Output:** If done correctly, the used program will output the necessary analysis results requested by the user.\n",
    "#### **Data Visualization**\n",
    "In terms of data visualization, the data from the dataset will need to be represented visually through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics and even animations.\n",
    "* **Input:** The user will first need to determine what type of graphics they want to visualize the data in, then they will need to specify the type of graphics through the Matplotlib module.\n",
    "* **Output:** The system will need to output the specified graphics requested by the user. The graphics outputted must be able to present the data correctly and easily.\n",
    "#### **Data Reporting**\n",
    "In terms of data reporting, the system will need to collect unprocessed data from different sources that can later be organized into meaningful pieces of information. These pieces of information can give valuable insights and statistics about the topic of the collected data.\n",
    "* **Input:** The user will need to request statistical information from the program.\n",

    "### **Non-Functional Requirements**\n",
    "#### **Usability:** A key non-functional requirement that determines how easily users can learn to operate, prepare inputs for, and interpret outputs of a system or software application. Usability ensures that the system is user-friendly, intuitive, and easily accessible to all users. The goal of usability is to ensure that users can efficiently complete tasks without any unnecessary complexity or confusion. **In simpler terms, usability refers to how easy and intuitive it is for users to interact with a system.**\n",
    "#### **Reliability:** Another key non-functional requirement focusing on the system's ability to operate consistently and correctly over time. Reliability ensures that the system performs its intended functions without failure and that any errors are handled appropriately. The goal of reliability is to provide accurate results to the user and also maintain data integrity. **In simpler terms, reliability refers to the system's ability to function correctly and consistently over time.**\n",
    "#### **What are required from the User Interface and a 'README' document in order to achieve usability?** \n",
    "**User Interface Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** The UI should be clean and straightforward, minimizing clutter and providing a clear pathway for users to accomplish their goals.\n",
    "- **Accessibility:** The UI should accommodate users with different needs, such as support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and adjustable text sizes. \n",
    "- **Responsiveness:** The UI should respond quickly to the user's inputs, without any extreme lag to the point of being noticeable.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Design elements such as colors, fonts and icons should be consistent across the application to prevent any confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**README Document Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Clear Instructions:** The README should provide straightforward, step-by-step instructions on how to install, configure, and use the program.\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Coverage:** The README should explain all the essential aspects of the system one by one, such as dependencies, troubleshooting tips, and examples of common use cases.\n",
    "- **User-Friendly Language:** The README should avoid technical jargon where possible, and be written in a way that is accessible to users of varying technical expertise.\n",
    "- **Regular Updates:** The README should be regularly updated to reflect any changes or updates to the program. This is to ensure that users have access to the latest information.\n",
    "#### **What are required from the system when providing information to the user on errors and ensuring data integrity?**\n",
    "**Error Handling Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Clear Error Messages:** When errors occur, the system should provide clear and informative error messages that explain what went wrong and how the user can resolve the issue. Vague messages such as \"An error occurred.\" should be avoided as it does not give the user an explanation or instructions on how to resolve the error.\n",
    "- **Graceful Degradation:** The system should continue to operate as smoothly as possible even when some minor components fail. For example, if a non-critical feature fails, the system should still allow users to perform other tasks while trying to fix the issue in the background. If the issue reaches a critical state, the system should give the user warnings and instructions on what to do.\n",
    "- **Logging and Reporting:** Errors should be logged with sufficient detail to help developers troubleshoot and resolve issues. The system may also need to report the critical errors to a support team or administrator automatically to simplify the issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Integrity Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Validation Checks:** The system should perform validation checks on all input data to ensure that it meets expected formats and criteria before processing. The purpose of this is to prevent any corrupt or invalid data from entering the system.\n",
    "- **Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups should be made to safeguard data against loss or corruption. On top of this, the system should also have a reliable recovery mechanism to restore data to a consistent state after a failure.\n",
    "- **Consistency Guarantees:** The system should ensure that data remains consistent across all parts of the system, even in the event of concurrent access or partial system failures."

    "#### **What should an application have to be secure?**\n",
    "An application requires many crucial security factors in order to be secure. The most important things that any application should have developed in order to build basic security are proper, reliable user authentication and authorization systems, which can protect against unauthorised access by ensuring that only authorised individuals or systems can access the data. Some more important security practices that developers should exercise is to add input validation, data storing, and secure encryption systems. Input validation ensures that only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, which can prevent malformed data from persisting in the database. Data storage systems help keep data and makes them easily accessible. Encryption is extremely important as it plays a major role in securing data from attackers and other cybersecurity threats. Aside from those, developers themselves should also use secure protocols and APIs, implement security testing, exercise error handling and logging skills, and make sure to maintain the application frequently.\n",
    "#### **Terminology**\n",
    "##### **User Authentication:** A process built in computer systems by developers that verifies a person's identity, allowing them access to an online service, connected device, or other resource.\n",
    "##### **Password Hashing:** A security process that turns a password into a short string of letters and numbers using an encryption algorithm. This process prevents cybercriminals from gaining access to people's passwords if a website is hacked.\n",
    "##### **Encryption:** A process that scrambles, converts and transforms data into incomprehensible text known as ciphertext, so that only authorized parties can understand and decode the information. Encryption plays a major role in data privacy.\n",
